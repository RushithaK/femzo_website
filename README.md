# FEMZO
# Description
A Women Safety Based Web Application,  which helps women in handling all kinds of unsafe situations.
# Abstract
The safety of women is a concern of increasing urgency in all the countries across the world.
The primary issue in the handling of these cases by the police lies in constraints preventing
them from responding quickly to calls of distress. These constraints include not knowing the
location of the crime, and not knowing the crime is occurring at all: at the victim's end,
reaching the police assuredly and discreetly is a challenge. The atrocities against the women
can be brought to an end with the help of our product "FEMZO". This device is a security
system, specially designed for women in distress.Our product basically helps the victim to
file a complaint and immediately she will be assisted by the organizations. To verify the
gender of the user the system inquires them to upload any Government Identity Proof. Also,
on an emergency note the victim can have a conversation with the organization. Users can
list out all the tactics shown in the website, which will be helpful for them in uncertain times.
They can locate the help centres and can get the details of them. Chat feature is provided in
the system for user’s queries with the organization. The system consists of this special feature
where the user can enter the destination and it will predict and will intimate whether the place
is safe or not. Once the victim files the complaint a confirmation message will sent to the
victim’s registered email address.
# Features
This Application helps users get to know of how to tackle abuses and assaults which happened to them physically or through cyber attacks.The Users can register in the website without revealing their identity to the organizations that run for the security of women.


# Technology Used:
- It is built using The DJANGO FRAMEWORK which uses Python language.
- ### MVT Architecture
    - Django is based on MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. MVT is a software design pattern for developing a web application. It is a Python-based web framework which allows you to quickly create web application without all of the installation or dependency problems that you normally will find with other frameworks.
    - MVT Structure has the following three parts :
        - Model: Model is going to act as the interface of your data. It is responsible for maintaining data. It is the logical data structure behind the entire application and is represented by a database (generally relational databases such as MySql, Postgres).
        - View: The View is the user interface — what you see in your browser when you render a website. It is represented by HTML/CSS/Javascript and Jinja files.
        - ViewModel: A template consists of static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.
